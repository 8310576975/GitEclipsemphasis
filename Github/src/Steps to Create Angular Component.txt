
a. Just go to Command line and navigate to 
	E:\JavaMLA160
b. ng new FirstAngularApp
c. cd FirstAngularApp
d. ng serve -------- This is to Launch the 
			development server
	This hosts our Angular applications
	This server will typically be served on 
	http://localhost:4200
	Once we will visit this link -------- 
	A default Angular application which was 
	created by CLR will be opened.	
	

1. We need to declare every new component here in 
app.module.ts which we want to add to our project.

We can do like this

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    UserComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})

2. Create a new component  -------- Simply right click on app -------- 
	new file
	Say -------- user.component.ts	
	We will write our own component code here

3. First  ------ export class

	export class UserComponent { }		

	For now no code will be there

4. After this we will implement a decorator
	For that we need to import --------- 
		import { Component } from ‘ @angular/core’ ;
	Then we will add @Component as a decorator
	In this we need to add selector, template
	@Component({
  		selector: 'app-user',
  		template: `<H3> Hello </H3>
      				<H4> May I know your Name : </H4>
  			  `

	})

5. Go to app.module.ts -------- In the declarations area --- 
	add following
		import { UserComponent } from './user.component'

6. Now go to app.component.html file and add <app-user> element.
